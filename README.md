UPDATE 02/18/22
I have completed TOP's Etch-a-Sketch, as least as far as I know of! It was very challenging creating this project because there were a lot of things that I did not know how to do, such as creating a grid using JS, adding color to the grid cell once the mouse hovered over it and having the color stay, and then clearing the grid and having it change size based on user input. What I learned from this project was more of an understanding on how to manipulate the DOM, using new methods such as .forEach(), .setProperty(), and using CSS variables and maniuplating it in JS. This was a tough, but very rewarding project!

This project will show my current knowledge of using JavaScript's DOM and CSS Grid & Flexbox.
